# Dialog_Agent_1819
A project for the course of "Software Engineering Laboratory", in which we've built a dialog agent with the purpose of integrate another already existing project in development.
The paralel project to ours consists in a evaluation method, based in questions, for the studens of the course of Databases in University of Minho. This questionary has themes and subthemes, like 'Databases' and 'Relational Model', in wich the student can be evaluated in certain topic. This questionary works together with the student's profiling, and this is where our project enters. We are responsible for the construction of a playful and ironic dialog agent, representative of the subjects' teacher, that uses the information of the students' profiling, number of questions answered about a topic, etc. With this info, we know if a student has frequently a nice performance, for example, or if he is answering all the questions right or taking to long, and send him messages acordingly to this factors and others.
